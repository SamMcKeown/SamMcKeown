### Sam McKeown
/Sam Mak-Oh-en/

Hey there! I'm Sam.

I was always fascinated with artificial intelligence, so during a global pandemic I decided to investigate the world of data science. 

Put simply, I love learning. I realised that python & machine learning just clicked for me & I soon found myself analysing most of my curiousities with code.

As a self-taught data scientist with no technical background, I would be really happy to share my experience with anyone looking to embark on a similar data science journey.
